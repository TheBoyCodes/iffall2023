        <h1>Intro Questions</h1>
        <p>1. My name is Vinayak Nair, I'm  a junior majoring in CS on the premed track.</p>
        <p>2. I've always been interested in optimizing user/patient experiences with 
            interfaces so I am taking this class as part of an HCI minor. </p>
        <p>3. I have a tiny, miniscule amount of experience tinkering over the summer to 
            make a widget to make data collection for a research project 
            I was working on easier. </p>
        <p>4. I hope to learn how to make clean, sleek webpages as well as some 
            principles of design</p>
        <p>5. The speed at which modifications can be made</p>
        <p>6. <a href= ”https://drakerelated.com/rooms/el-chico-studios”>DrakeRelated.</a> This website is a good example of 
            effective design because it is designed as an interactive house tour and the idea of 
            seeing all of the different facets of Drake's musical career through "walking through"
            a house is pretty intuitive.
        </p>
        <p>7. <a href=”https://www.tropicana.com/”>Tropicana.</a> This website is a good example of effective communication
            primarily because of the simple messaging that encompasses the site. It has a clean color palette and 
            as a consumer I am easily guided to the products that are being sold.
        </p>
        <p>8. <a href=”https://www.airbnb.com/”>Airbnb.</a> This website is a good example of a site that works 
            well. I think that the layout is very intuitive and clean; I know exactly where 
            to go to access the different functionalities offered. As someone who has used it multiple times, 
            I have never had a problem with it when booking places. </p>
