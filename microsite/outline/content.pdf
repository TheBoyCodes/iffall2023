Project Title: FNIRS Website 

FNIRS, or Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy is an imaging technique used to capture activity in the brain’s cortical regions. The technique is very interesting personally and I would like to build out the site as multiple pages, with multiple pages connected to a navigation bar. There is enough photography on FNIRS that I could use to give each section enough imagery.
- Description – Introduce the main ideas behind how FNIRS works - with some diagrams
- History - Side by side comparison of the US/UK and Japanese FNIRS development 
- Data Analysis Software
- Application - not all of what is listed on the wikipedia but most of it.
- Comparison to other Neuroimaging Techniques - ex: MRI, EEG, PET
- Sources – this page will list sources, including the Wikipedia page, as well as other  sources for photography, and any other credits that need to be provided.
